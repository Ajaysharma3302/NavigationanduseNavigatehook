# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
This project demonstrates how to set up a simple React app with a navigation bar and multiple pages using `react-router-dom`. It covers the implementation of navigation using both the `<Link>` component and the `useNavigate` hook for programmatic navigation.


- **React Router** for routing between pages.
- **Navbar** component with navigation links to Home, About, Products, and Contact pages.
- **Programmatic navigation** using `useNavigate` for dynamic page transitions.
- **Declarative navigation** using `<Link>` for traditional anchor-style routing.
